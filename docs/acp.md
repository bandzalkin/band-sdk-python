# ACP (Agent Client Protocol) Integration

Facts about the ACP integration that span modules or that the code cannot say for
itself. The client side is `ACPClientAdapter` (Band room → room-owned ACP subprocess);
the server side is `ACPServer` + `BandACPServerAdapter`.

## Configuration

`ACPClientAdapterConfig` holds the plain settings; `CursorACPAdapterConfig`,
`CopilotACPAdapterConfig` and `OmpACPAdapterConfig` extend it with backend defaults
and fields. Callables (`workspace_for_room`, `resolve_session_config`,
`resolve_permission`) are keyword-only constructor arguments.

```python
from band.adapters import ACPClientAdapter, ACPClientAdapterConfig

config = ACPClientAdapterConfig.model_validate(
    {"command": "codex-acp", "turn_timeout_s": 600}
)
adapter = ACPClientAdapter(config)
assert adapter.config.command == ("codex-acp",)
```

## Band tools

- **Injected tools are bound to the room.** With `inject_band_tools` on (the
  default), the adapter hosts one loopback `LocalMCPServer` and gives each room's
  session that room's endpoint (`/rooms/<room>/mcp`, or `/sse`), so the tools take no
  `chat_id` and the prompt never states one. A reloaded session gets the same endpoint.
  If that server dies, the next message replaces it on a new port, and a room whose
  session still dials the old one gets a fresh session with the transcript replayed.
- **An external Band MCP server takes the room as an argument.** With
  `inject_band_tools=False` (a remote `band-mcp`), the session's first prompt states
  `Current chat_id` for its tools to use.

## Turn delivery

- **Narration is live and ordered.** `ACPCollectingClient` streams finalized chunks to
  `RoomTurnEmitter` as they arrive, so a Band tool's own room post (a remote band-mcp
  posts over REST mid-turn) lands between its `tool_call` and `tool_result`.
- **Held agent text is thought telemetry.** At clean prompt close, successful
  external Band-tool effects are recorded first; held native text is an optional
  thought without mentions, suppressed after a successful reply or decline.
  It never settles a turn. Failed tools alone and native-only output reach the
  shared missing-reply verdict, with thoughts enabled or disabled.
- **Injected Band tools record their own successful effects.** With
  `inject_band_tools=False`, completed external tool effects are staged from
  normalized identities until successful close. Failed calls record nothing.
  Such peers need external Band tools to reply or decline; native text alone
  no longer supplies room replies.
- **`emit=` never gates effects or resume state.** The closing session `task`
  carries restoration identifiers after held-text handling, regardless of flags.
  Runtime judging may report an error afterward. Failed/cancelled prompts post
  neither held text nor resume state.
- **Migration:** delete retired `assistant_text_mode` config keys; explicit
  configs reject them. Tool filters narrow SDK-injected registrations; external
  MCP servers remain outside SDK registration control.
- **Approved permissions are silent.** Only a denied request posts a synthetic
  `tool_call`/`tool_result` pair, and only when `Emit.TOOL_CALLS` is on.
- **Replay happens once**, only for a freshly minted session (a failed `session/load`
  counts), under a nonce'd boundary marker so a replayed message cannot spoof it. History
  stops strictly before the triggering message (`messages_before`).

## Busy-session backpressure

Only a structured ACP `RequestError` with code `-32003` and
`data.reason == "session_busy"` proves that the prompt was rejected without starting
work. The adapter retries that response with asynchronous exponential backoff from
0.25 seconds to a maximum of 5 seconds, within the existing `turn_timeout_s` budget.
It keeps the same runtime and session and does not post a failure or cancel the
autonomous work that owns the session.

If either the adapter budget or the runtime cycle watchdog expires while the prompt
remains rejected, the runtime leaves its delivery failed and actionable for recovery
without consuming the ordinary message retry budget or acknowledging it as processed.
Local contact events have no durable delivery row, so the runtime retains them in
queue order until accepted; stopping the room pauses their retry until play.
Cancelling a busy wait does not send `session/cancel`, and shutdown cancellation
still terminates the execution loop. Once a prompt might be running, the existing
turn timeout and cancellation behavior still applies. Transport errors and other
provider errors are not replayed by this busy-response path.

Band bootstrap is remembered only after an ACP prompt completes. A deferred first
prompt still receives system context and, for a fresh session, transcript replay when
retried. A restored session receives Band system context without duplicating its remote
transcript.

Each retry uses a fresh stream collector and reply emitter. Notifications received
during a rejected prompt cannot settle that attempt's reply or suppress the accepted
retry's reply.

OMP 18.6.1 emits this structured busy response; the generic internal error emitted by
18.6.0 does not qualify. This recovery does not give Band ownership of OMP's autonomous
turns or guarantee forwarding of their unsolicited output.

## Isolation

- The per-room workspace (`./.band-workspaces/<room-id>`) is not an OS sandbox; configure
  the agent's own sandbox when that boundary matters.
- TCP and custom transports are rejected: one remote process cannot be proven to serve
  exactly one room.

## Session config

`resolve_session_config` runs after each new or restored session and before its first
prompt. Each successful `session/set_config_option` response replaces the catalog the next
selection is validated against (choosing a model can change the reasoning levels). Any
failure fails that room turn visibly instead of falling back.

## Backends

- **OMP:** `approval_mode="yolo"` bypasses OMP's native approval and gives the agent full
  access to its host. It does not change Band tool registration or platform permissions.
  `OmpACPAdapterConfig.model` is passed as OMP's `--model` flag; OMP does not read an
  `OMP_MODEL` env variable. Set `api_key` with it and the adapter passes the key in the env
  variable that model's provider needs.
- **Cursor:** question, plan and permission decisions default to `manual`, resolved by a
  room participant with `/cursor <word> <token>`. Cursor omits the session id on its
  extension notifications, so the adapter holds a turn lock and binds them to that turn's
  session; Cursor turns are serialized. Decision prompts, timeout notices and `/cursor`
  replies post through `send_notice`, so they never count as the model's reply, and a
  `/cursor` message settles its own turn without reaching the agent. A turn parked on a
  decision releases its message early (`tools.turn.detach()`), so it is judged when the
  ACP turn completes normally; a failed or cancelled turn is never reported as a missing
  reply.
  The adapter does not pick a plan/agent mode itself; a caller selects one through
  `resolve_session_config`, which reads each session's advertised catalog before the
  first prompt. The live `backends` lane pins the Cursor CLI and passes `E2E_CURSOR_API_KEY`
  as `CURSOR_API_KEY` only to its baseline step; local runs may use a stored `agent login`.

## Server prompt outcomes

`ACPServer.prompt` settles on the first terminal outcome for its room:

- Completed text returns `end_turn`; `session/cancel` returns `cancelled`. A Band `error`
  rejects the prompt with JSON-RPC `internal_error`, the Core failure projection in
  `error.data`; room cleanup and agent shutdown also fail it. A second prompt while one is
  pending in that room is rejected with `invalid_params`.
- Room events bind to a prompt only once its Band post returns, so a previous turn's
  late event stays unsolicited and cannot settle the prompt or drop the send. A terminal
  outcome releases the prompt even while its Band REST send is still pending. One
  timeout bounds the send and the reply together.
- Error updates carry the same projection on the agent-message chunk's `_meta`, unsolicited
  errors in mapped rooms included. Their text and projected keys and values are
  credential-redacted; values under credential-named fields are redacted in full.
- The ACP Python client drains queued update handlers before surfacing a prompt error, so
  a slow client handler can still delay its own `prompt()`.
