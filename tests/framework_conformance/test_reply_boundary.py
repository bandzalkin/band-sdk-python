"""Reply boundary test.

A ``send_message``, ``deliver_reply`` or ``relay_reply`` call counts as the
turn's reply, so only the model's own words may go through one. An adapter's
own post (an approval prompt, a busy notice, a status reply) goes through
``send_notice``, or it would stand in for the model's answer and suppress the
final-text relay. This scans ``src/band`` via AST and pins every such call
outside the tool implementations, per file with the reason it carries the
model's words, so a new reply call anywhere fails here until it is justified.
