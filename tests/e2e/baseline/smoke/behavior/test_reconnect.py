"""Live reconnect-behavior coverage for BandLink's SubscriptionTracker adoption.

Forces a real WebSocket transport disconnect (not the clean disconnect()/
connect() lifecycle) so the transport's own reconnect logic and
BandLink._on_reconnected run for real against the live platform — the part a
mocked-transport unit test can't prove. Single fixed adapter: this is a
transport-layer concern, not adapter-specific, so it doesn't need the full
matrix (matches test_isolation.py / test_processing_barrier.py precedent).

    own reconnect plus BandLink._on_reconnected must leave it fully usable.

    Requests ``cell.run_as_with_handle`` (not the managed ``agent`` fixture) so
    the test can reach the running agent's own transport via
    ``agent.runtime.link`` — both already-public properties — to force the
    disconnect.

    Proof that ``_on_reconnected`` itself ran comes from a spy wrapping
    ``link._drain_reconciliation``, not from the message round-trip alone:
    a room's ``ExecutionContext`` also carries an independent
    ``idle_resync_seconds`` REST re-poll (60 s, backing off to 300 s) with no relationship
    to WebSocket reconnect at all, so a reply arriving after the disconnect
    does not by itself prove the reconnect path executed — it could equally
    be explained by that unrelated fallback quietly picking up the slack
    while the socket stayed dead. The spy is a direct, structural signal
    instead of an inference through log text or a side effect.
