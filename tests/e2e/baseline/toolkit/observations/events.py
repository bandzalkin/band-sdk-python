"""Emitted-event capture and assertions for live E2E tests.

The non-``tool_call`` event kinds an agent emits in a turn -- the free-text
``thought`` / ``error`` / ``task`` ``MessageType``s. They read back via the Human
messages API (``UserOps.list_messages``) on the same durable, race-free
"read after the barrier" path :class:`ToolCalls` uses (see ``tool_calls.py`` for
the contract), only filtered to a different ``message_type``.

Unlike ``tool_call`` (JSON ``{name, args}``), this content is **free text**, so
matching stays substring-based -- no JSON parsing. A shared :class:`Events` base
carries the read and the tolerant assertions; the thin subclasses
:class:`Thoughts` / :class:`Errors` / :class:`Tasks` just bind their
``MessageType`` and can grow bespoke assertions later.

Tests reach this through ``ReplyCapture.thoughts`` / ``errors`` / ``tasks`` (or
the generic ``ReplyCapture.events``).
